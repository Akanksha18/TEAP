Coding Style
------------
The best to see the actual coding style is to see how the src/signals/DMY dummy
signal library. Anyway these are the main baselines:

Indentation:
The indentation should be made with the use of TABs to adjust to the identation
level, then with spaces. Ex:
	if(this_long_function(
	    will_overflow) {
		Bar
	}

Variable naming:
Variables should be camelCased except for signal structures that should have
a uppercase character, then all the rest in lowercase.

Function naming:
Functions should be named following this scheme:
SSS_rrr_eee
Where SSS is the signal name (eg. EEG, ECG, etc.),
rrr is the role of the function (eg. aqn=acquisition, get, wrk=work, ect.),
eee are the extra attributes (eg. file, realtime, etc.).

Here are some examples:
ECG_aqn_file(filename), ECG_aqn_realtime(), ECG_wrk(Signal).
