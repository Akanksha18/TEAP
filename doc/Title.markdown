#TEAPhysio documentation

###Abstract
TEAPhysio (Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals) is a Matlab 
(fully Octave compliant) toolbox that aims to reduce code dispersing and 
duplication across projects. TEAP supports various signals (ECG, BVP, GSR, EEG, 
etc.) and it's aim is to allow the user to quickly use the signal's features 
without any more code. TEAP is also programmed in an OOP sort of way. It is 
really easy to program signal feature code.
