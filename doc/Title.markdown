#TEAPhysio documentation

###Abstract
**TEAPhysio**, the *Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals*, 
is a Matlab (fully Octave compliant) toolbox that aims to reduce code dispersing 
and duplication across projects.

TEAP supports various signals (*ECG*, *BVP*, *GSR*, *EEG* and some more) and 
it's aim is to allow the user to quickly use the signal's features without any 
more overhead coding. TEAP is also programmed in an OOP sort of way: it is 
really easy to program signal feature code or to add another signal structure to 
the toolbox.
