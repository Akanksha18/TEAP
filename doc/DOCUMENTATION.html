<H3>Abstract</H3>
<P>TEAPhysio (Toolbox for Emotion Analysis using Physiological signals)
 is a Matlab (fully Octave compliant) toolbox that aims to reduce code
 dispersing and duplication across projects. TEAP supports various
 signals (ECG, BVP, GSR, EEG, etc.) and it's aim is to allow the user to
 quickly use the signal's features without any more code. TEAP is also
 programmed in an OOP sort of way. It is really easy to program signal
 feature code.</P>

<P>TEAPhysio is a toolbox. You can also view-it as a library. That is,
 you can easily add a specific signal into you workspace and extract
 it's features using TEAP.</P>
<P>As you'll see, TEAP is divided into 2 main components: <CODE>Signals</CODE>
 and <CODE>Bulk signals</CODE>.</P>
<P>A <CODE>Signal</CODE> may be viewed as a channel from the acquisition
 card (except for things like EEG and ECG (which uses 2 differential
 signals), but these specific cases are embedded in within the signal).</P>
<P>A <CODE>Bulk Signal</CODE> can be viewed as the acquisition card: a <CODE>
Bulk Signal</CODE> consists of multiple signals.</P>
<P>An important thing about TEAP is that TEAP is stateless: that is,
 each function works on a variable (mainly structures, but you don't
 have to know that) and returns a variable. No global variables or
 states are used.</P>
