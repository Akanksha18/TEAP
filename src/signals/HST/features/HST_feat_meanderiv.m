function [meanTemp HSTsignal] = HST_feat_mean(HSTsignal)
%Computes the mean derivation of the HST signal.
% Inputs:
%  HSTsignal: the HST signal.
%
% Outputs:
%  meanTemp: the mean derivation of the temperature, in dÂ°C/dt
%  Signal: the HST signal with the values computed inside: will be faster if
%          you run-it a second time: if the feature was already comptued for
%          this signal, only fetches the results.
