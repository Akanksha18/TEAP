function [meanTemp HSTsignal] = HST_feat_mean(HSTsignal)
%Computes the mean of the HST signal (aka the mean temperature)
% Inputs:
%  HSTsignal: the HST signal.
%
% Outputs:
%  meanTemp: the mean temperature, in Â°C
%  Signal: the HST signal with the values computed inside: will be faster if
%          you run-it a second time: if the feature was already comptued for
%          this signal, only fetches the results.
% WARNING: this function will give 'strange' results when applied on a relative
%          signal
