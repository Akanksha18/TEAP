function [meanTemp] = HST_feat_mean(HSTsignal)
%Computes the mean of the HST signal (aka the mean temperature)
% Inputs:
%  HSTsignal: the HST signal.
% Outputs:
%  meanTemp: the mean temperature, in Â°C
%
% WARNING: this function will give 'strange' results when applied on a relative
%          signal
