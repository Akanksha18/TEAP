function Signal = Signal_filter1_low_pass(Signal, cutOffFreq)
%A simple low-pass filter applyed to 1D signals (such as GSR, ECG, etcâ€¦).
% Inputs:
%  Signal: the signal to filter (will use the .raw component). Not a bulk sig. !
%  cutOffFreq: the cutOff frequency of the filter
% Outputs:
%  Signal: the low-passed-signal
